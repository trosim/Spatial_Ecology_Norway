# Spatial_Ecology_Norway
A Practical Guide with tutorials, examples, receipts and documentation for the application of R in spatial ecology within a Norwegian context. 

There are several good books, tutorials and examples of the practical application of methods and techniques in spatial ecology, landscape ecology and physical geography. However, when methods (including scripts) are applied in a new context and with new data, adjustmets are often needed. The current project is developed to save time and share and develop ideas for the authors, and to make the material avliable for e.g. tutorials used for teaching, courses, collaboration within research projects, etc.

The project has not yet a clear goal, and will develop along the way.
